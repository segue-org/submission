        city: ...
      }
###### creates an entry in the Caravan table

2) see caravan details
<----- GET http://server/api/accounts/:id/caravan

         city: ...
         owner: ...
       }

3) invite people to caravan

         city: ...,
         owner: ...
       }

          { ...caravan product for period 1... },
          { ...caravan product for period 2... },

      {
        kind: 'person',
